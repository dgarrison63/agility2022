Lab BIG-IP 261: Deploying F5 on Equinix Metal and Equinix Fabric
================================================================

With the release of Equinix Metal, enterprises now have a great option
for deploying resources on bare metal at the network edge. Additionally,
since Equinix Metal is integrated into the Equinix Fabric, it provides
an excellent location for a centralized access endpoint into an
organization’s multi-cloud environment.

This lab will step you through the process of deploying a
scalable application delivery infrastructure on top of Equinix Metal
using the F5 BIG-IP. The BIG-IP tier provides advanced layer 4/7 traffic management and security services.
In this configuration, the BIG-IP instances can operate in either an “active/
active” or “active/standby” mode depending upon application requirements
and services utilized. However, due to lab resource contstraints, you will deploy a 
single insstance the BIG-IP.

Additionally, you will be able to choose whether you want to deploy BIG-IP on either the VMware or KVM hypervisors - your choice.
