Assign elastic IP addresses
---------------------------

To connect to the BIG-IP management interface from outside the Metal
environment, you need to assign a **Public IPv4** /31 elastic IP address
block that you provisioned in a previous step to the Ubuntu
instance. (See Figure 11 on the next page.)
