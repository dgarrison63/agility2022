Configure BIG-IP
----------------

Instead of using the BIG-IP web UI to configure the BIG-IP, you will use
the BIG-IP CLI and TMSH commands to configure the BIG-IP instances.
You will need to supply a unique license key for the BIG-IP
as well as adjust references to IP addresses to match the IP addresses
you are using.

Once all of the TMSH commands have been entered on the BIG-IP
instance, 

**NOTE:** The KVM console can be a little difficult to work with and you
may want to use SSH to configure the BIG-IP instances instead. Also,
highlighted below in red are entries that you may have to change;
however, if you have used the same RFC1918 IP addresses, then the only
items you will have to change are the license key and the virtual server
elastic IP address block.
